I need to be proactive in getting involved in more complex projects.
Block out time my calendar for focused work. I use MS To Do and aiming to be more consistent in utilizing the tool.
In the coming year, I am aiming to invest more time in learning new technologies, including a Certification on Google Cloud technology.
I am also planning to spend more time on reading and watching videos or online course to improve my productivity, communication and leadership skills.
