1. Add annotations related to SSL Redirect
  - Redirect from HTTP to HTTPS
  - Provides a method for configuring custom actions on a listener, such as for Redirect Actions.
  - The action-name in the annotation must match the serviceName in the ingress rules, and servicePort must be use-annotation

2. Add the Custom Action Annotation
     # SSL Redirect Setting
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/actions.ssl-redirect: '{"Type": "redirect", "RedirectConfig": { "Protocol": "HTTPS", "Port": "443", "StatusCode": "HTTP_301"}}'   

3. Add the following Path as first ingress rule in the Rules section
          - path: /* # SSL Redirect Setting
            backend:
              serviceName: ssl-redirect
              servicePort: use-annotation     

4. Deploy all manifests and test
# Deploy
kubectl apply -f kube-manifests/

kubectl get ingress 

5. Access Application using newly registered DNS Name
# HTTP URLs (Should Redirect to HTTPS)
http://ssldemo.awsk8scloud.com/app1/index.html
http://ssldemo.awsk8scloud.com/app2/index.html
http://ssldemo.awsk8scloud.com/usermgmt/health-status

# HTTPS URLs
https://ssldemo.awsk8scloud.com/app1/index.html
https://ssldemo.awsk8scloud.com/app2/index.html
https://ssldemo.awsk8scloud.com/usermgmt/health-status

6. Clean Up
kubectl delete -f kube-manifests/
