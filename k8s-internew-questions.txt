What are the different components of Kubernetes Architecture
A. The master node has the kube-controller-manager, kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler, etcd. Whereas the worker node has kubelet and kube-proxy running on each node.

What is statefulset

Single container vs multi container pod: init container, 

What is static POD?
Static Pods are managed directly by the kubelet daemon on a specific node, without the API server observing them.
Unlike Pods that are managed by the control plane (for example, a Deployment); instead, the kubelet watches each static Pod (and restarts it if it fails).
Static Pods are always bound to one Kubelet on a specific node.

What is deamonset?
A DaemonSet ensures that all (or some) Nodes run a copy of a Pod. As nodes are added to the cluster, Pods are added to them. As nodes are removed from the cluster, those Pods are garbage collected.
Some typical uses of a DaemonSet are:

running a cluster storage daemon on every node
running a logs collection daemon on every node
running a node monitoring daemon on every node
